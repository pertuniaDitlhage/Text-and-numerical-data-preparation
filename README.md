# Text-and-numerical-data-preparation

Text Data Pre-processing

Tokenization: Splitting text into words/sentences.

Normalization: Converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation.

Stopword Removal: Filtering out irrelevant words.

Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms.

Handling Raw Text Data: Parsing labeled datasets and exporting structured data.

Numerical Data Pre-processing

Handling Missing Values: Imputing or removing null entries.

Encoding Categorical Data: Converting text categories into numerical values.

Feature Scaling/Normalization: Standardizing numerical ranges.

Data Type Conversion: Ensuring correct formats.

This project honed essential data preparation skills for machine learning and analytics, ensuring datasets are clean, structured, and analysis-ready. These skills are foundational for roles in data science, machine learning, and business analytics.
